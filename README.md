## Project Overview

The goal of this case study is to analyze lead data and build a predictive model that can score leads based on their likelihood to convert. This scoring system will allow the sales team to focus their efforts on the most promising leads.

## Features
- Logistic regression model for lead scoring
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data patterns
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curves
